# PyKasaCloud

This is a package for interacting with the Kasa Cloud API. Much of the leg work was performed by [piekstra](https://github.com/piekstra) in [tplink-cloud-api](https://github.com/piekstra/tplink-cloud-api).

It uses some code from the excellent [kasa-python](https://github.com/python-kasa/python-kasa) library.

It's primary intention is to support a Home Assistant integration to complement the built [Tp-Link Smart Home](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/tplink/) integration.  Currently it only supports a small subset of functionality.
